# French Fusion

## Description

This MATLAB project allows French learners to use a language learning application. The goal of this project is to explore and demonstrate language learning can be applied to appdesigner and development within Matlab.

The project provides MATLAB scripts that allow you to run the program and utilise the applications different features. You can easily experiment with different parameters and settings to see how they affect the final output. See how the program is run [here](youtube.com).

## Concepts Implemented

- **Story**: Immerse users in engaging graded readers featuring French and English texts, enhancing language comprehension and grammar skills through captivating narratives.

- **Translator**: Integrate a versatile translation tool, enabling seamless conversion of French words to English for improved communication and vocabulary expansion.

- **Challenge**: Incorporate interactive challenges with varying difficulty levels, gamifying language learning and encouraging users to enhance their vocabulary and language proficiency through engaging tasks.
