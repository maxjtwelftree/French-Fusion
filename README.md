## Description

This MATLAB project enables those learning French to engage with a language learning tool. It aims to showcase how language learning can be integrated into app designer and progression in Matlab.

The project provides MATLAB scripts that allow you to run the program and utilise the applications different features. You can easily experiment with different parameters and settings to see how they affect the final output.

See how the program is run [here](youtube.com).

## Concepts Implemented

- **Story**: Immerse users in engaging graded readers featuring French and English texts, enhancing language comprehension and grammar skills through captivating narratives.

- **Translator**: Integrate a versatile translation tool, enabling seamless conversion of French words to English for improved communication and vocabulary expansion.

- **Challenge**: Incorporate interactive challenges with varying difficulty levels, gamifying language learning and encouraging users to enhance their vocabulary and language proficiency through engaging tasks.

## Features

- Apply linguistic algorithms to text
- Integrate contextual knowledge to enhance understanding
- Generate language usage insights for unique patterns
- Easy-to-use MATLAB scripts for text translation and analysis
- Experiment with different language models and settings
- Visualize the translation process and save the results

## Installation

To install and utilise the application, click myApp.m and download. Additionally download every file located within the assets folder and save them to the same directory as the myApp.m file. 

Once the necessary files are downloaded in MATLAB, type, 'myApp' within the command window and the application will be run and later show.
